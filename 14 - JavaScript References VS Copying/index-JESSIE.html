    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players
    console.log(players, players2)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players2.push('Jessie')
    console.log(players, players2)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players3 = players2.slice()
    players3.push('joe')
    console.log(players3, players)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players)
    players4.pop()
    console.log(players4, players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players]
    players5[2] = 'luisa'
    console.log(players5, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.name = 'Jessie'
    console.log(person, captain)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Joe'})
    console.log(cap2, person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
