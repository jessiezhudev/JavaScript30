## Target:
Simulate how a clock works. Hands rotate when time goes.

## Skills we need to grasp:
1. JS `Date()` related function - to get current seconds, minutes, and hours.
2. `transition` and `transform` related CSS - how to change the `transform-origin`, and change `transition-timing-function` to simulate how a clock goes.
3. Use `element.style` to change hands' rotation degree.
