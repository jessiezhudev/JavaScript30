I really like this chapter since it provides me with very important JavaScript array functions exercises. 
And they are all practical enough to understand and practice those functions.

Unlike `forEach` function or `for` loops which tells the program how to do something, the array functions in this tutorial are great examples of declarative programming - directly tell the program to do something.

1. Filter()

Filter receives a function as a parameter to iterate through each element in array. And return a new array with all elements that pass the test.

2. Map()

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

3. Sort()

The sort() method sorts the elemetns of an array according to the function it receives and returns the array.

4. Reduce()

The reduce() method receives a function as parameter, and the function receives two parameters `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The `accumulator` is the result of lastStep.

In the end, if you're unfamiliar with above JavaScript array methods, Mozilla docs are your friend.
